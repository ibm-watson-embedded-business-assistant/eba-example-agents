## Assets tab

EBA UI is implemented using React.js as the foundation library. Official React.js documentation can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs). All data snippets you can see in the conversation, content or graph areas are implemented using corresponding React.js components. You are welcome to utilize a few native [ui components](./UIComponents.md) during the course of development.

We use auto discovery for data visualization components: give your component a name following the following convention: `<concept namespace>_<concept name><suffix>` where suffix can be one of:

- `Data` – will be used both in conversation area and Knowledge Graph
- `Node` – will be used in Knowledge Graph only
- `Content` – will be used on Content tab and in full screen mode. 

Note that you likely want to use multiple suffix types for the same concept. For example, if you are rendering data for weather, you will likely want to show this both within the chat panel as well as the content panel. A concise, largely textual representation of the weather can be provided within `weather_WeatherData`, while a larger, graphical representation will be provided within `weather_WeatherContent`. 

The following properties will be given to your component in `@props`:

- `data` – concept’s data in JSON
- `node` – information space node
- `colors` – d3 ordinal colors you can use as the consistent palette

Under any circumstances UI component **must not modify** data passed through `@props`.

[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) library is widely used for data transformations. Consider it if it fits your needs.
