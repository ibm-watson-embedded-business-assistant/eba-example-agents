### Patterns

A pattern effectively contains an annotated question that you would like your assistant to answer. Annotations are delineated following the format `{token|concept}`. For example, `show me {status|:Status} of these {sales orders|:Orders}` is one pattern entry. This pattern conveys a number of things to your assistant. First, it tells the assistant that the tokens "status" and "sales order" may be considered to refer to `:Status` and `:Orders` concepts respectively, which is useful in the course of natural language understanding. Additionally, it provides a sequence of tokens which influence the reasoning engine's scoring metrics. Because we have supplied a direct annotation `{sales order|:Order}`, the system will favor this interpretation to other competing interpretations, e.g. `{sales|:Sales}` `{order|:Order}`.

Concepts are color coded within the lab to help assistant readability.
