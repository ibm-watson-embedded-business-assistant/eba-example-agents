### Explore Tab

This tab is responsible for visualizing the various components that constitute your assistant. Watson Assistant may be represented as a graph composed of nodes and edges. The selector legends located in the top left corner of the explore screen will allow you to toggle and inspect various details of the graph.

The nodes legend allows us to set certain inspection criteria. We can specify which nodes to include as well as which nodes to exclude using regular expressions. Additionally, we may specify which connected nodes to show by toggling the fields labeled: include neighbors, include incoming, include outgoing, and include disconnected.

The edges legend allow us to toggle which types of edges to be show, where edge labels are determined by the predicates specified within your ontology.
