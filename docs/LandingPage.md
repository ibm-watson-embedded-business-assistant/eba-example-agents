## Programming Watson Embedded Business Assistant

The Watson Embedded Business Assistant (EBA) consists of a reasoning engine and a set of domain agents. Agents can be programmed and directly executed using this lab. 

As you begin your agent development, you may want to familiarize yourself with the [components](./components/Components.md) necessary for building an agent, as well as with the [development lab](./lab/Overview.md) that is used to program them. We have a [getting started tutorial](./getting-started/GettingStarted.md) for new developers, as well as a set of useful [samples](./Samples.md) to help you get started. For Watson Assistant integration with your product take a look at [headless](./integration/Headless.md) and [web](./integration/Web.md) integration options.
