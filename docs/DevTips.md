## How to disable Chrome's two-finger back/forward navigation?

Google Chrome on Mac supports two-finger swipe gesture to navigate across pages.
Sometimes, this leads to unconditional page reload and potential data loss which is
frustrating when you are working on something essential.

**There is a quick fix:** Open Terminal, run the command below, and restart your browser.
It will disable two-finger back/forward navigation for Google Chrome only.
Change parameter to `TRUE` to revert changes if needed.

```
defaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE
```
